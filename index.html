                Egusi soup is unarguably the most popular Nigerian soup. In my few years a Nigerian food lover, I have learned that different recipes exist across different Nigerian ethnic groups. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Yorubas make efo elegusi while the Igbos make ofe egusi, all with similar ingredients but with slightly different approaches.This is how to make egusi soup with lumpsâ€¦ the kind you only get to eat when you visit a 5-star restaurant or hotel ðŸ˜€.

                <h2>Preparation</h2><br>
                <b>Step 1</b>
                <br>
                Grind the four cups of egusi with a dry blender or hand-grinding machine and set them aside in a bowl. Add about a cup of water to it and stir to make a very thick paste, as you can see below.

                <b>Step 2</b>
                <br>
                Parboil the meat with all the ingredients, it is advisable to parboil meat with some ingredients before adding them to the principal food, this improves the taste of the meat.<br><br>
                
                <b>Step 3</b>
                <br>
                Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of sliced onions.<br><br>

                <b>Step 4</b>
                <br>
                Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, then set aside. Also, remove the center bone from the roasted fishes, wash and set aside too.<br><br>

                Set your cooking pot on the fire and add 300ml of palm oil (red oil), allow to heat for a minute but donâ€™t allow to bleach. Add the egusi paste and keep stirring for the next eight to ten minutes to form seed-like crumbs. See the image below.

                <b>Step 9</b>

                Allow to simmer on low heat for 2 minutes, stir, and you just made a delicious pot of egusi soup<br><br>

                You can serve with eba or fufu, in fact, any of the Nigerian swallows will make an impressive combination. <br>
                I also enjoy eating this soup and pounded yam together.<br>
